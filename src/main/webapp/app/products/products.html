				<h4>SaturnVPN</h4>
				<p>
					SaturnVPN is an advanced VPN solution which not only can be used to protect local network, but it can also be used by individual to bypass overly restrictive institutionalized firewalls.
				</p>
				<p>
					A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPN enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Privacy is increased with a VPN because the user’s initial IP address is replaced with one from the VPN provider. This method allows users to obtain a new IP address from any gateway city the VPN service provides. For example, you may live in London but after connecting to the VPN, you can appear to live in Berlin, Chicago, or any number of gateway cities.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you browse the web while connected to a VPN, your computer contacts the website through the encrypted VPN connection. The VPN forwards the request for you and forwards the response from the website back through the secure connection. VPNs use advanced encryption protocols and secure tunneling techniques to encapsulate all online data transfers.

				<h5>Benefits of using SaturnVPN</h5>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Hide Your Browsing Activity from Your Local Network and ISP:</b> If you’re using a public Wi-Fi connection, your browsing activity is visible to everyone nearby, if they know how to look. You can connect to a VPN if you want to hide your browsing activity and improve your security.</li>
					<li><b>Access blocked websites:</b> Many websites in some countries are blocked. If you want to access these websites, you can use VPN and open blocked websites. You can even access some geo-restricted websites like Netflix, Pandora, and Hulu which can only be accessed within some specific countries like USA or UK without VPN. You can open these websites by connecting to the USA or UK VPN.</li>
				</ul>
